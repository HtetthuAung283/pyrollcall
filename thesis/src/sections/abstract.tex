In my semester project, I prototyped a roll call system called \textbf{pyRollCall} in Python 3.5 to automate
the traditional roll call procedures with deep metric learning.
\newline

Normally, a teacher needs to call each student's name one by one in order to check who is present
at a class. This system aims to simplify the traditional roll call procedures by pre-computing each
student's facial embeddings using \textbf{dlib}, so that it can identify students' faces correctly later
with \textbf{OpenCV} as well as \textbf{face\_recognition} module and completely automates roll calls.
