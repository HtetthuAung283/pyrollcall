\section{Discussion}
Since this system is merely a prototype, it still leaves a lot to be desired. For example, I have
not confirmed how many photos must be provided per person in order to make the system recognize each person
correctly. Too few photos will lead to false facial recognition.
\newline

There might also be some alternative approaches that can improve the accuracy of facial recognition. These
issue can be carried on in subsequent studies.
