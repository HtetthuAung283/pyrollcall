Ching Hisang Chang (2012) published a paper regarding an RFID roll call system.
By installing an RFID reader near the entrace of a school or classroom, students' attendance
can be recorded with ease as they walk pass the RFID reader. In comparison with the FRT approach,
this method offers the best compromise between convenience and security since no personal information
have to be collected at all, while FRT roll call system requires students to provide their personal
photos in advance. However, this approach can lead to fraudulent sign-in activites because
one can simply carry the student cards of their other fellow students and exploit the mechanism
of the RFID roll call system.
