\section{RFID Chip Scanning}
In 2012, Ching Hisang Chang published a paper regarding an RFID roll call system.
By installing an RFID reader near the entrace of a school or classroom, students' attendance
can be recorded with ease as they walk pass the RFID reader. In comparison with the FRT approach,
This one offers the best compromise between convenience and security since no personal information
have to be collected at all. However, this approach can still lead to fraudulent sign-in activites
because students can simply carry the student card of their other fellow students and
exploit the mechanism of the roll call system.
