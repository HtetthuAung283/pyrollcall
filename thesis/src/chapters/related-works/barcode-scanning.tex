\section{Barcode Scanning}
Several cram schools in Taiwan, such as Chen-Li Educational Group, are known for
using barcode scanning to record student attendance. When students arrive at the
cram school, they are required to show their student ID card to the staff before
they can enter the classroom. Their student ID card has a barcode printed on it
and the staff will use a barcode scanner to record the attendance of each student.
Although this approach has been implemented for a while, it can be inefficient
if the size of classroom is too large, since students usually have to wait
in a very long line before entering the classroom.
