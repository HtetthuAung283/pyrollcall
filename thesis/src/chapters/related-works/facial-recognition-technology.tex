\section{Facial Recognition Technology}
In 2018, William E. Miller proposed a solution to recording classroom attendance using
Facial Recognition Technology (FRT). The author provides three Python scripts in its
appendicies which can assist school faculties in performing automated roll calls using FRT,
but it only supports Windows and it seemingly lacks a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
Consequently, we perform extensive research in this area based on his previous works,
proposing the architecture of a cross-platform and easy-to-use roll call automation system.
By making this system cross-platform, we open up many possibilities in this area such as
enabling the installation of our system on a portable embedded system like Raspberry Pi.
