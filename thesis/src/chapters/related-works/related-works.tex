\chapter{Related Works}
In this chapter, we review the related works on roll call systems using:
(1) FRT, (2) barcode scanning, (3) RFID chip scanning and (4) GPS location tracking.
Although various methodologies has been proposed in previous studies, roll call systems
using FRT are less frequently studied comparing to other ideas. Currently, there is no
"the best way" to perform a roll call, since each approach will usually have
its own vulnerabilities and can be exploited by the students. Hence, we will also
discuss the pros and cons of each methodology.
