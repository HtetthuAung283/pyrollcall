Much research has already been conducted on roll call automation using technologies, and various approaches
such as using facial recognition, barcode scanning, RFID chip scanning and GPS location tracking has been
proposed in previous studies. However, each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, which means
each method has its own vulnerability and can be exploited by students, leading to fraudulent sign-in
activities during roll calls. In this chapter, we will review the related works that have been conducted
on this subject and discuss the pros and cons of each methodology.
