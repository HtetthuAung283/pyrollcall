\mySection{GPS Location Tracking}
Zuvio IRS \cite{zuvio-irs} is a digital education tool which has been widely used in many Taiwanese universities
including National Taiwan University, National Central University, National Taiwan Normal University, etc.
It allows teachers and students to perform online quizzes, discussions and roll calls. The most
important feature we will be discussing here is \emph{Online Roll Calls using GPS Location Tracking}.
When a teacher starts a roll call session, the students are required to use the Zuvio application
on their mobile devices to sign in to a class. As a student clicks the "sign in" button, the system will
check their location using GPS, and the students are expected to be near to the classroom. However, this
system can be exploited with a GPS location spoofing program which can fake users' locations,
leading to possible fraudulent sign-in activities.
