\subsection{OpenCV}  % 4.1.1.26
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a cross-platform computer vision and machine learning library which was
originally developed by Intel Corporation. It can be used to develop real-time image processing, computer vision
as well as pattern recognition programs. The library is primarily written in C++, thus most interface of
OpenCV is for C++ and C. It also has bindings for other programming languages such as Python, Java and MATLAB.
Our project utilizes OpenCV for capturing images from a camera.

\subsection{dlib}  % 19.18.0
Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools to solve complex real world problems.
It is widely used in various fields such as robotics, embedded devices, mobile phones, and large high performance
computing environments. The specific use of \emph{dlib} in PyRollCall is employing deep metric learning algorithms
and dlib models to solve facial recognition tasks.

\subsection{face\_recognition}  % 1.2.3
face\_recognition is an easy-to-use face recognition library which is built upon dlib's state-of-the-art
deep metric learning model with an accuracy of 99.38\%. We use face\_recognition to detect faces in an image,
estimate facial landmarks, compute a 128-d measurement for each face and perform facial classification.
