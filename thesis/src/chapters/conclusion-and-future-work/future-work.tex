\mySection{Future Work}
Finally, we discuss the opportunities for future work. Currently, the system is decentralized and
is designed for faculty's personal use, but future work can be done to expand the size of this project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The system architecture can be adjusted, allowing multiple users to use the system simultaneously.
  \item RESTful technologies can be employed to integrate the roll call system into student information systems.
  \item Advanced features such as notifying the parents of a student via SMS can be developed.
\end{itemize}
