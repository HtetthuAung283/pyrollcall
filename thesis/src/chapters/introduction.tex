\section{Introduction}
With the rapid growth of technology, more and more repetitive tasks can be automated by programs.
In my semester project, I built a system to replace the tedious procedure of a traditional roll call.
\newline

Initially, the users (typically teachers) are required to populate the database with the information
of the courses and students he/her teaches. Secondly, the users have to take several photos of each
student presented in the database and compute their facial embeddings. Lastly, the program can start
identifying students' faces and help users automate roll calls.
