With sufficient photos of students provided and their facial embeddings pre-computed,
the system will be able to detect and recognize faces correctly. However, to save time
in classes, teachers and students will have to spend equivilently extra amount of time
before classes on the tasks such as collecting photos and pre-computing facial embeddings.
This proves that there is a trade off between convenience and efficiency.
