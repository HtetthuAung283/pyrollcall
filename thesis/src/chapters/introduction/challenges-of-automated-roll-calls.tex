\section{Challenges of Automated Roll Calls}
Human beings can correctly identify familiar faces even under certain circumstances such as poor illumination,
facial expressions, partial face occlusions, aging and facial appearance changes. However, this might not always
be the case for a computer system. Partial face occlusions and facial appearance changes can pose two of the most
challenging problems in a roll call automation system using Facial Recognition Technology.

There are two typical ways to use the roll call automation system, either (1) take photos of all students individually,
or (2) take photos of all students at once. The former approach can take much more time than the latter one, but it
is obviously easier to request students to remove the accessories that occlude some parts of their faces. The latter
method requires only one photo taken but it could be harder to achieve, since not all students would simply cooperate.
