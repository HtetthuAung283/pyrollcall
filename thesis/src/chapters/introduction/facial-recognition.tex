\section{Facial Recognition Technology (FRT)}
Facial Recognition is a technology which is capable of identifying or verifying the individuals in a digital image or video.
Generally, it consists of four steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Face detection
  \item Face normalization
  \item Facial feature extraction
  \item Classification
\end{enumerate}

The first step to perform in facial recognition is to identify all the faces in it. The biggest challenge of face detection
is that faces can be tilted and turned to any direction, and the program must be able to detect them regardless of
these situations. There are also some other factors that can prevent the faces from being correctly detected:
lighting, expressions, noises, face occlusions, etc. Secondly, the faces have to be normalized before performing
facial feature extraction. This step can include geometric normalization, lighting normalization, angle normalization.

Now we are ready to extract the unique features from a face, but questions arise: which features should we collect, and
how should we quantify a face? It could be the width between the eyes, the length of the nose, or even the width-height ratio
of the face. It turns out that the best approach is to let the computer itself figure this out by deep learning.
This is usually done by training a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which can generate a face encoding for each face
in the image. The last step is comparing this face encoding with other face encodings that already exist in the database.
If a match is found, then we've successfully identified an individual. The above process is actually similar to how we
identify people in real life:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find all the faces within our vision.
  \item Identify the faces regardless of their angle, direction and lighting.
  \item Look for the unique features of the faces.
  \item Compare these unique features with all the people you know.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Face Detection}
Face Detection went popular in 2001 when Paul Viola and Michael Jones published the \emph{Violaâ€“Jones object detection framework},
enabling objects on a camera to be detected in real time. Later on, more robust approaches are proposed. We will be using
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) in our system for this task.
