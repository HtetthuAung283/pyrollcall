\section{Overview}
PyRollCall is able to run on Windows, MacOS and unix-like systems as long as
the system has Python3 installed. All of its external dependencies are already packaged
in the project via Python's \emph{virtual environment}, making its installation easier.

The system comes with an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for users, allowing teachers to easily
(1) Maintain the data of the course and students they teach,
(2) take photos of students via camera,
(3) train the network using the photos of students,
(4) perform roll calls and
(5) export students' attendance to files.
